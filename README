We have provided the resources necceasary to generate the figures from ``Locality sensitive hashing for the edit distance'' by Guillaume Mar√ßais, Dan DeBlasio, Prashant Pandey, and Carl Kingsford. Which is to appear inthe proceedings of ISMB/ECCB 2019.

The two main directories contain the necceasry code to produce the phylogeny figures (`is_trees`) and the random sequences figure (`random_sequences`).
All of the figure generation is performed in a combination of `perl` and `python`. 
The `omh_compute` directory contains the code neccesary for the figure generation and is written in `c++`. 
This directory needs to be compiled before anything can be run in the other two.
